# Steps to install: 

1: Download the Barony_8P.rar from the releases

2: Copy your Barony game from your Steam files and place the game in a new folder and title it Barony MP, Barony 8p etc.

3: Place the folders and the Barony_MP.exe from the .rar file into the copied folder and hit "Replace" when prompted.

4: Launch with the Barony_MP.exe click "Play Game" and Online or Lan depending on what you're doing

5: Make sure there are arrows on the character sheet lineup.

# Important: 

Do not click "Play Modded Game"; nothing happens.

# A tip: 

The mod has most likely worked if the Seed Events tab does not appear.
